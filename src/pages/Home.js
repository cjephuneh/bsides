        <p className="leading-9 text-2xl mb-24">
          In recent years there has been a rise in data breaches affecting organizations
          across various industries and continents and Kenya is no exception. Data breaches
          have far-reaching consequences, undermining trust and privacy and exposing
          sensitive information to malicious actors. Data breaches continue to present a
          challenge to organizations. How do you prevent one? What do you do in the event
          a data breach occurs? What steps do you take in order to successfully recover?
          All these are questions that linger when we see headlines of breaches. This yearâ€™s
          conference is aimed at having these conversations, sharing knowledge and creating
          a collaborative environment for discussing best practices on preparedness and
          handling of data breaches.
